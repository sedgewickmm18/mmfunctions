Playground for Maximo Asset Monitor

Please see the [repo wiki](https://github.com/sedgewickmm18/mmfunctions/wiki) for more information.


Now this includes a slightly modified copy of the [Telemanom](https://github.com/khundman/telemanom) regression based anomaly scorer. Please see also find the corresponding paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04431)
The novelty lies in the nonparametric, unsupervised approach for thresholding errors (as the difference of actual vs predicted/forecasted) and identifying anomalous sequences of errors.
